# Phone Verification Implementation Test Plan

## Summary
Successfully implemented phone number verification for both signup and signin flows in ReceiptGold app.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified/Created:
1. **PhoneAuthService.ts** - Firebase phone authentication service
2. **PhoneVerificationScreen.tsx** - UI component for phone verification flow
3. **SignUpScreen.tsx** - Added phone input field and two-step verification
4. **SignInScreen.tsx** - Added option to sign in with phone number

### Key Features:
- ✅ Phone number validation and formatting
- ✅ Firebase phone authentication integration
- ✅ Test phone number support (+1 415-555-0015 with code 123456)
- ✅ Two-step verification process (phone → code)
- ✅ Account linking (email + phone for signup)
- ✅ Phone-only signin support
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ TypeScript compatibility

### Test Scenarios:

#### Signup Flow:
1. User enters email, password, confirm password, and phone number
2. System validates all inputs including phone format
3. Creates email/password account first
4. Navigates to phone verification screen
5. User enters phone number and receives SMS code
6. User enters 6-digit verification code
7. System links phone number to email account
8. User is fully registered and authenticated

#### Signin Flow:
1. **Email Signin**: Traditional email/password flow (unchanged)
2. **Phone Signin**: 
   - User clicks "Or sign in with phone number"
   - Navigates to phone verification screen
   - Enters phone number and receives SMS
   - Enters verification code
   - Signs in with phone-only authentication

### Firebase Configuration:
- Test phone number: +1 415-555-0015
- Test verification code: 123456
- Production phone numbers will use real SMS

### Security Benefits:
- Prevents trial abuse across devices
- Additional verification layer
- Phone number as unique identifier
- Integrates with existing device fingerprinting system

## Next Steps for Testing:
1. Test signup flow with test phone number
2. Test signin flow with phone authentication  
3. Verify account linking works correctly
4. Test error scenarios (invalid codes, network issues)
5. Test production with real phone numbers
