# Stripe React Native Setup for ReceiptGold

## âœ… What's Been Set Up

### 1. Dependencies
- `@stripe/stripe-react-native` - Already installed in package.json

### 2. Environment Variables
- Added `EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` to `.env.example`
- You need to add this to your actual `.env` file with your Stripe publishable key

### 3. Components & Services Created

#### StripeWrapper Component (`src/components/StripeWrapper.tsx`)
- Wraps your app with Stripe provider
- Handles Stripe initialization
- Includes merchant ID and URL scheme for deep linking

#### Stripe Service (`src/services/stripe.ts`)
- Handles customer creation via Cloud Functions
- Manages checkout sessions
- Provides subscription tier configurations
- Formats prices for display

#### Stripe Hook (`src/hooks/useStripePayments.ts`)
- Easy-to-use hook for components
- Handles subscription flow
- Manages alerts and redirects

### 4. App Integration
- Updated `App.tsx` to include StripeWrapper
- Updated `PricingLanding.tsx` to use Stripe payments
- Firebase Functions integration for backend operations

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Needed

### 1. Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_actual_key_here
```

### 2. Stripe Dashboard Setup
1. Create products in Stripe Dashboard
2. Get price IDs for each subscription tier
3. Update price IDs in `src/services/stripe.ts`:

   - `price_professional_monthly`

### 3. Cloud Functions
Make sure your Firebase Cloud Functions include:
- `createStripeCustomer`
- `createCheckoutSession`
- `stripeWebhook` (for handling subscription events)

### 4. Deep Linking (Optional)
Configure URL scheme in `app.json`:
```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "receiptgold"
  }
}
```
