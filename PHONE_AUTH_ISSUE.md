# Phone Authentication Issue - Expo + Firebase

## Problem
The current implementation is failing because:

1. **Wrong SDK Approach**: Using Firebase JS SDK with Expo, but trying to use React Native Firebase methods
2. **Missing reCAPTCHA**: Firebase JS SDK requires reCAPTCHA for phone auth, but React Native doesn't have DOM elements
3. **Platform Mismatch**: The documentation you provided is for `@react-native-firebase/auth`, but this project uses standard `firebase` package

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use Third-Party SMS Service (Recommended)
Replace Firebase phone auth with a service like:
- **Twilio SMS** - Most reliable, used by many production apps
- **AWS SNS** - Cost-effective, good integration
- **Expo Notifications** - For basic verification codes

### Option 2: Switch to React Native Firebase (Major Change)
- Install `@react-native-firebase/auth`
- Would require ejecting from Expo managed workflow
- Provides native `verifyPhoneNumber` with callbacks as shown in docs

### Option 3: Web-Compatible Approach (Current Attempt)
- Create invisible DOM element for reCAPTCHA
- Handle web-based flow in React Native WebView
- Complex and not ideal UX

## Recommendation
For production use, **Option 1 (Twilio SMS)** is the most reliable approach for Expo apps. Firebase phone auth with Expo has known limitations and complexity issues.

Would you like me to:
1. Implement Twilio SMS verification instead?
2. Keep the current Firebase approach and create a workaround?
3. Document this as a known limitation?
